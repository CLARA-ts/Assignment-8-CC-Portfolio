"It is a really cute watch, the dial is mechanical, and it's pink color whitch have some kitty pattern."

fill pink
draw a half circle on top
draw a rect under
draw a half circle below
draw a circle in the middle 
draw a circle (smaller)
push()
draw a rect()
draw another rect()&rotate()
pop()

I want to rotate the rectangle by(200,200)but I failed to do that.
I give up the hello kitty part after creating a few arcs. 
It is too hard for me.
